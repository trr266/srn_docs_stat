# SRN Documents Statistics Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the **srn_docs_stat** repository, a versatile toolkit designed to streamline the process of downloading data from the SRN documents database API and performing essential summary statistical analyses on the acquired data. This repository is a resource for gaining insights into the dataset's characteristics.

## Functionality

The repository provides range of tests and features:

### 1. Failed Downloads Analysis

Identify and compile records of files that were unable to be downloaded, along with accompanying error messages.

### 2. Filetype Classification and Renaming

Categorize the downloaded files based on their filetypes and optionally append appropriate suffixes to the local file names for improved organization.

### 3. Filetype Frequency Evaluation

Analyze the distribution of filetypes among the locally downloaded files to gain a deeper understanding of the data composition.

### 4. Missing Files and Company Linkage

Establish connections between missing files and their corresponding companies, offering insights into systematic gaps within the dataset.

### 5. Yearly Frequency Assessment

Evaluate the frequency distribution of years within the downloaded dataset, aiding in identifying temporal patterns.

### 6. Selective Downloads

Implement a feature to exclusively download files that are not already present in the local directory, enabling updates as the database continues to evolve.

## Output and Data

The repository's "output" folder contains a snapshot of the tables generated by the code.

The "data" folder contains the actual documents that are downloaded from the SRN API. By default and before running the code, this folder is empty. 

## Usage

To get started, simply clone this repository and follow the provided instructions in the documentation. This repository seeks to help researchers to understand the power and limitations of the SRN documents data with ease.
